# Polarity RiskIQ SIS Integration

![mode:on demand only](https://img.shields.io/badge/mode-on%20demand%20only-blue.svg)

> Due to the time it can take for lookups against certain indicators, we recommend that this integration be run in "On Demand Only" mode.  Setting integration's to run on demand only is a feature available starting in Polarity Server `3.7.5` and Polarity Web `3.4.21`.

As attacks against the organization increase, itâ€™s more important than ever to have a security program built on robust and reliable data to enrich analysis and inform the decision-making process. RiskIQ offers the ability to ingest critical security data programmatically at scale.

The Polarity RiskIQ integration allows Polarity to search RiskIQ Security Intelligence Services (SIS API) to return threat information on IP's, Domains and URL's.

More information on RiskIQ SIS please see https://www.riskiq.com/products/security-intelligence-services

For information about the RiskIQ API please see https://api.riskiq.net/api/concepts.html

This option allows you to specify a regex to set domains.  Any domain matching the regex will not be looked up.
